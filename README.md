## Project Summary

We were given a data set from XYZ Bank and ask to create a model  for future use using spark that predicted whether a client would subscribe for a term deposit. In addition we were also asked to conduct a Exploratory Data Analysis along with our prescriptive recommendations. 

After transforming the data we built and evaluated multiple models and determined that a Gradient Boosting Tree was the best model.

We attempted to save the model using the model.save() function as instructed but continued to get a Pyspark exception error. Unfortunately, we were unable to meet this requirement. 

For greater detailed see the attached paper.
