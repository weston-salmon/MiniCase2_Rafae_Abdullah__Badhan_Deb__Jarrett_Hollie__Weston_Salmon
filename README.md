## Project Summary

We were given a data set from XYZ Bank and ask to create a model  for future use using spark that predicted wheter a client would subscribe for a term deposit. In additon, we were also asked to conduct a Exploratory Data Analysis along with our prescriptive recomendations. 

After transforming the data we built and evaulated multiple models and determined that a Gradient Boosting Tree was the best model. 

For greater detailed see the attached paper.
